# React-memory-game
## Memory game built with React and Bootstrap 4!
### This is a memory game that gives you 12 images that should only be clicked one time!  
### It has counters to let you know how many have been clicked on the round you are on, as well as keeping track of your highest streak.
### If you click on the same image twice it will let you know you lost that round and reset.
### If you click all 12 without clicking any image twice, it will announce you won! and reset for another round.
